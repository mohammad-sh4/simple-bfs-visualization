# Simple BFS Algorithm with Visualization

This repository contains a straightforward implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in Python, complete with visualizations for each step. The visualization highlights node states and the BFS queue, making it an excellent resource for learning or teaching the fundamentals of graph traversal.

## Features
- **Simple Implementation**: Designed to be beginner-friendly with clear and concise code.
- **Visual Step-by-Step Execution**: 
  - Node colors indicate states:
    - **White**: Not yet discovered.
    - **Light Blue**: Currently being explored.
    - **Soft Gray**: Fully explored.
  - The BFS queue is dynamically displayed.
- **Graphviz Integration**: Produces clean and professional-looking visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `graphviz` Python library
- Graphviz system tool installed
